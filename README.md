# node-red-flow-freezer-monitor
Node-Red flow used for notifications and remote monitoring of freezers

This flow demonstrates how freezer monitoring can be accomplished with no monthly subscription fees.  Notifications can be sent when the freezer gets above a certain temperature and when the freezer returns to normal.  A dashboard with the current temperature as well as a line graph can also be remotely accessed on iOS and Android devices.  Full article is available on https://ncd.io
